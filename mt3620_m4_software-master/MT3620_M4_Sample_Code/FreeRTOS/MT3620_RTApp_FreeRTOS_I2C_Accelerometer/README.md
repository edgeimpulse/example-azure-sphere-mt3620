# Sample: MT3620 M4 real-time application - FreeRTOS I2C Accelerometer
### Description
This sample demonstrates how to control the AVNET on-board LSM6DSO accelerometer by MT3620 real-time core.
- ISU0 UART interface is used to print the output log.
- ISU2 I2C interface is used as the I2C Master to control the LSM6DSO.  
(Note, This sample code works only on AVNET development board.)  
(Note, UART port number in main.c could be changed from **OS_HAL_UART_ISU0** to **OS_HAL_UART_PORT0** to use M4 dedicate UART port.)  
Please refer to the [MT3620 M4 API Reference Manual](https://support.mediatek.com/AzureSphere/mt3620/M4_API_Reference_Manual) for the detailed API description.

### Prerequisites
* **Hardware**
    * [AVNET MT3620 Starter Kit](https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/avnet-engineering-services/aes-ms-mt3620-sk-g-3074457345636825680/)
* **Software**
    * Refer to [Azure Sphere software installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure-sphere/install/overview).
    * A terminal emulator (such as Telnet or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) to display the output log).
