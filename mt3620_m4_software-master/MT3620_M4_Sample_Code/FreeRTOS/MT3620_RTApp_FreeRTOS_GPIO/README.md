# Sample: MT3620 M4 real-time application - FreeRTOS GPIO
### Description
This sample demonstrates how to use GPIO and UART on an MT3620 real-time core.  
- On-board LED_Red(GPIO8) and LED_Green(GPIO9) are used as GPIO output.
- On-board Button_A(GPIO12) and Button_B(GPIO13) are used as GPIO input.
- ISU0 UART interface is used to print the output log.
- Users could press Button_A to turn on LED_Red, and release to turn off.
- Users could press Button_B to turn off LED_Green, and release to turn off.  
(Note, UART port number in main.c could be changed from **OS_HAL_UART_ISU0** to **OS_HAL_UART_PORT0** to use M4 dedicate UART port.)  
Please refer to the [MT3620 M4 API Reference Manual](https://support.mediatek.com/AzureSphere/mt3620/M4_API_Reference_Manual) for the detailed API description.

### Prerequisites
* **Hardware**
    * [AVNET MT3620 Starter Kit](https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/avnet-engineering-services/aes-ms-mt3620-sk-g-3074457345636825680/) or [Seeed MT3620 Development Kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Azure-Sphere-MT3620-Development-Kit-US-Version-p-3052.html)
* **Software**
    * Refer to [Azure Sphere software installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure-sphere/install/overview).
    * A terminal emulator (such as Telnet or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) to display the output log).
